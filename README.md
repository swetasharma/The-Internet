# The-Internet


If I didn't learn how to programming, It would be like not learning how to read.

Representing and Transmitting Information:

Sending Binary Messages:
Wires, Cables and WiFi:

How does picture, text message or emails gets send form one device to another? 
The Internet : A tangible physical sytem made to move information. The interbet is lot like postal services but the physical stuff that gets send is litte bit different instead of like boxes and envelopes The internet ships binary information.

Information is made of bits. beacuase bits has two possible state we call it binary code. 8bits = 1byte, 1000 bytes = 1kilo byte, 1000 kilo bytes = 1 Mega Byte.
A song is typically encoded using about 3-4 Mega Bytes. It does not matter if its a picture or video or song everythinh on the internet is represented as bits these are the atoms of information. today we physically send bits by electricity, light and radio wave 


Bitrate: the number of bits per second a system can transmit.
Latency: time it takes for a bit to travel from sender to receiver.
8 Milliion bits = 1 mega byte
bitrate = 8 mbps
to send bits really long distance(we are talking like across occeans) what is fatser than electiricity? Light : we can send bits as light beams from one place to another using fibre optic cable we can actually send multiplpe bits simultaneously all of them travelling at the speed of light (fibre is really really fast)
how do we send things wirelessly? wireless bits sending machne typically uses radio signal to send bits from one place to another.The machines have to actually translate the 1's and 0's into radio waves of different frequesncy the receiving maching reverse the process, convert it back to the binary on your computer.if you are onthe coffee shop using wifi then the bits gets send through the wireless router and then transmitted to the physical wire to travel the really long distances of the internet. everything on the internet comes down to 1's and 0's
