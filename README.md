# The-Internet


If I didn't learn how to programming, It would be like not learning how to read.

Representing and Transmitting Information:

Sending Binary Messages:
Wires, Cables and WiFi:

How does picture, text message or emails gets send form one device to another? 
The Internet : A tangible physical sytem made to move information. The interbet is lot like postal services but the physical stuff that gets send is litte bit different instead of like boxes and envelopes The internet ships binary information.

Information is made of bits. beacuase bits has two possible state we call it binary code. 8bits = 1byte, 1000 bytes = 1kilo byte, 1000 kilo bytes = 1 Mega Byte.
A song is typically encoded using about 3-4 Mega Bytes. It does not matter if its a picture or video or song everythinh on the internet is represented as bits these are the atoms of information. today we physically send bits by electricity, light and radio wave 


Bitrate: the number of bits per second a system can transmit.
Latency: time it takes for a bit to travel from sender to receiver.
8 Milliion bits = 1 mega byte
bitrate = 8 mbps
to send bits really long distance(we are talking like across occeans) what is fatser than electiricity? Light : we can send bits as light beams from one place to another using fibre optic cable we can actually send multiplpe bits simultaneously all of them travelling at the speed of light (fibre is really really fast)
how do we send things wirelessly? wireless bits sending machne typically uses radio signal to send bits from one place to another.The machines have to actually translate the 1's and 0's into radio waves of different frequesncy the receiving maching reverse the process, convert it back to the binary on your computer.if you are onthe coffee shop using wifi then the bits gets send through the wireless router and then transmitted to the physical wire to travel the really long distances of the internet. everything on the internet comes down to 1's and 0's


What is THE INTERNET?
the internet links billions of devices together all around the globe. May be you are connected to the laptop or phone through wifi then that wifi connection connects to service provider(ISP) and then ISP connects you to billion and billions of devices around the world through hundred and thousands of networks that are all interconencted 



IP Addresses and DNS:
PROTOCOL: A well known set of rules and standards that all participating user allow them to communicate without trouble.

All the different devices on the internet have unique addresses. An address on the interbet is just a Number similar to phone number or
street address that' unique to each device on the network.

A computer address is called an IP address. these nunmbers are organised in hierarchy just like a home address has a country, city, street and house number ip address has many parts.just like all digital data each of these numbers is represented in bits. Traditional IP addresses are 32 bits long with 8 bits for each part of the address.

country / network, region / network , subnetwork , device

ipv6 uses 128 bits per address. DNS associate names www.example,com with the corresponding addresses. your computer uses the DNS to look up doman nanmes then get the associated ip addresses which is use to connect your computer to the destination on the internet.there is no way one DNS server can handle all the request from all the devices DNS servers are connected in distributed hierarchy.splitting up the responsibility for the major domain (.org, .com, .net etc)

DNS spoofing : when a hacker taps into DNS server and chnages it match domain name with the wrong ip address. thius lets the attacker to send people to foster website.
